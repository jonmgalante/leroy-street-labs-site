# Leroy Street Labs

Placeholder site for **Leroy Street Labs**.

Live:
- https://leroystreetlabs.com
- https://www.leroystreetlabs.com

## What this is
A minimal static site hosted on **GitHub Pages** and mapped to the custom domain **leroystreetlabs.com**.

## Update the site
1. Edit `index.html` (and/or `assets/*`)
2. Commit + push to the default branch
3. GitHub Pages will auto-deploy

## Domain + DNS
- Apex (`@`) points to GitHub Pages via A records:
  - 185.199.108.153
  - 185.199.109.153
  - 185.199.110.153
  - 185.199.111.153
- `www` is a CNAME to `jonmgalante.github.io`

## Notes
- HTTPS is enforced via GitHub Pages once the certificate is provisioned.
- This repo is intentionally lightweight so it’s easy to replace later with the real site/app.
